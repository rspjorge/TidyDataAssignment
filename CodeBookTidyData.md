## Variable description

# Descriptive variable names:

1.      Leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
2.	Body = related to body movement.
3.	Gravity = acceleration of gravity
4.	Acc = accelerometer measurement
5.	Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
6.	Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
7.	Mag = magnitude of movement
8.	mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements. 

The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. They total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.
